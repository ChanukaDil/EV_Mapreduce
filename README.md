# EV_Mapreduce

This project implements a Hadoop MapReduce solution in Java to analyze real-world electric vehicle registration data. The primary objective is to calculate the number of EVs registered in each county using a large public dataset. By leveraging the power of distributed computing with Hadoop, the project efficiently processes and aggregates data at scale, providing insights into regional EV adoption patterns. The workflow covers environment setup, data preparation, MapReduce implementation, execution, and results interpretation demonstrating practical skills in large scale data analysis using cloud computing technologies.
